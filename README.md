# Talk to AI Assistant

A middleware client for AI chats: it stores conversation history locally, helps you manage dialogues (search, tags, delete individual messages), and lets you work with different providers (LLMs).

> Idea: even if a provider’s official chat is slow or fails to load, your history and chat organization remain available in the app.
